class RadixSort:
    """
    Class to sort a list of non-negative integers using the radix sort algorithm.

    Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that processes numbers digit by digit, 
    starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). 
    It uses a stable sorting method at each digit level (typically counting sort or bucket sort). 
    The key idea is that numbers are grouped into buckets based on their current digit.

    Time Complexity:
        - Best/Average/Worst: O(n * k), where n is the number of elements, and k is the number of digits.

    Limitations:
        - Only works on non-negative integers in this implementation.

    Attributes:
        arr (list): List of non-negative integers to be sorted.

    def sort(self):
        """
        Sorts the list in ascending order using radix sort.

        The algorithm works by:
        1. Finding the number with the most digits.
        2. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.):
            - Placing each number into a bucket (0â€“9) based on that digit.
            - Rebuilding the list by concatenating buckets in order.

        Returns:
            list: The sorted list in ascending order.
